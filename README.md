# Deep Learning Based Segmentation of Multicontrast TNBC PDX MR Images
This repository provides an automated pipeline for automatic localization and segmentation of multicontrast MR images in small animals. In this project we have tried using UNet, Residual UNet, Dense UNet, Recurrent Residual UNet(R2UNet) and Dense Recurrent Residual UNet (DR2UNet)
